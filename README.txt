A C-like interpreter written in C++11

Currently does not work with pointers (and probably never will) due to the nature of pointers and how they don't mix well with interpreters. This project will most likely be abandoned, but I'm fairly certain I'll reuse the code later to make another interpreter or compiler, because most of the code is very functional.
